                            <p>While other locations will connect with these two airports, Santiago, Chile (SCL) will be the easiest major international airport for most visitors to fly via.</p>

                                <p>Road / adventure style kit is the way to go on this motorcycle tour, rather than off-road or enduro gear. So that means a good helmet, protective riding jacket and trousers, ideally with CE or equivalent approved armour on the pointy bits – elbows, knees and shoulders.</p>

                                <p>You are also going to need good leather gloves, a neck tube, thermal base layers and a sturdy pair of motorcycle boots.</p>

                                <p>Please bring waterproofs if your kit doesn’t keep out the wet stuff.</p>

                                        <p>At the time of writing, British nationals do not need a visa to enter Argentina or Chile as a tourist for periods of 90 days or less. However, we always recommend you check the foreign office website for the most accurate and up to date information relating to visas and other entry requirements.</p>

                                        <p>To be legally riding in Argentina and Chile you are required to carry your local driving licence, which must cover the size of bike you will be riding. This will also be a stipulation of any travel insurance company too.</p>

                                        <p>You will also need an International Driving Permit (IDP). An IDP is basically an official, multi-language translation of your driving licence.</p>

                                        <p>You will also need some paperwork to cross borders with your motorcycle, but we take care of all of this for you.</p>

                                        <p>This tour is a mix of tarmac and gravel roads, so you will need to be competent and confident riding a similar size motorcycle on the gravel.

You will only need money for the items not listed as inclusions, which is mainly just alcohol, souvenirs, some evening meals and any other personal spending. Unless you go mad in the gift shops and bars, around £300 – £400 should be adequate. Shopping in Chile and Argentina tends to be very reasonable so you can get quite a lot for not much!</p>

                                        <p>Motorcycling in Patagonia is adventure in its purest form: forget busy highways with convenient fuel stations and roadside cafes, bustling cities and fast WiFi. Out here, it feels as though you’re traveling in the outback, so remote and so untouched by civilisation you will almost feel like you’re the first human on Earth.</p>

                                    </p>This motorcycle tour of Patagonia is an all-encompassing route, designed as a truly ‘once in a lifetime’ adventure that ticks all the boxes, leaving no stone unturned and sending you home with a feeling of accomplishment, knowing that you’ve just ridden one of the World’s greatest motorcycle adventures.</p>

                                <p>We’ll travel some of Patagonia’s most scenic routes including the famous Ruta 40 and Carreterra Austral, stay in traditional haciendas, experience the gaucho culture and reach Ushuaia, AKA “The World’s End”. Ushuaia is the southernmost city of the planet which has long been the absolute pinnacle of adventure motorcycling destinations.</p>

                                <p>Along the way, we’ll zig and zag between Chile and Argentina traversing the otherworldly Patagonian landscape, cross Torres del Paine National Park, see the natural marble caves, the Perito Moreno glacier and taste the famous Argentinian steak.</p>

                                <p>Expect the unexpected, prepare for some gravel roads and strong winds, and let the adventure begin!</p>

                                <p>We’ll skirt around some of Argentina’s most picturesque lakes, catch a glimpse of Volcano Lanin and hit a region known as the Argentinian Switzerland, with San Carlos de Bariloche as our destination for the day. Bariloche is beloved by locals and travellers alike: famous for its awe-inspiring scenery, bright turquoise lakes corralled by the snow-capped peaks of the Andes and its quirky mountain town vibe, Bariloche is a must-see in Argentina.</p>

                                <p>Along the way we have our first border crossing, enjoying a traditional style picnic lunch in the countryside, lots of chances to stop for photos, and of course enjoy the phenomenal riding in the Argentinian Patagonia.</p>

                            <FullDescription>
                                <p>Another incredible day of riding today as we’ll join the legendary Ruta 40, Argentina’s most famous road frequented by two-wheeled travellers from around the world.</p>

                                <p>We’ll ride the fantastic Circuito Chico to admire the views of the Lake Perito Moreno, then head South, following the thrilling twisties to Butch Cassidy’s ranch where we’ll stop for lunch and take a tour of the notorious gunslinger’s cabin. Rumour has it, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid held up a bank in Rio Gallegos clearing away over $100,000, but thanks to a tip off from a local Sheriff they managed to escape arrest. True or not, the legend is still alive &amp; well here in rugged Patagonian cowboy country.</p>

                                <p>Traveling towards Futaleufu (beers are on us if you can pronounce that correctly the first time!), we will experience the insane riding through Los Alerces National Park and end the day back on the Chilean side of the border.</p>

                                <p>It’s a relaxed day designed to let you catch a breather and take advantage of the breakfast buffet and swimming pool, before we take you for some dirt riding. For the first 50km, we’ll ride a gravel road followed by 90km of tarmac with plenty of curves and bends. Next up is a 40km gravel stretch of vertigo-inducing switchbacks (take it easy on this section!) and then 20kms of paved bliss to finish off the day.</p>

                                <p>Our hotel has no road access, so when we’re finished with the bikes, we’ll hop on a boat that will take us across the water. If you like natural hot springs, this resort will be right up your street. There’s no internet here and it’s a great place to really switch off from the world, have a long soak in the thermal pools, and relax, admiring the shimmering Southern Cross in the unpolluted Chilean skies.</p>

                                <p>If Coyhaique is the capital of Chilean Patagonia, Puerto Rio Tranquilo, is one of its most iconic gaucho towns still retaining the spirit of an authentic, remote outback trading post. Think cowboys, sheriffs, and saloons: founded in the early fifties as a hub for local ranchers, Puerto Rio Tranquilo has stunning natural beauty and a wonderful rugged atmosphere.</p>

                                <p>We’ll cover the first 95km of paved roads, then tackle some 120km of gravel with a few sections under construction here and there. Keep an eye out for trucks on the road, but don‘t forget to take in the scenery: today, we’re entering the very heart of Chilean Patagonia.</p>

                                <p>Along the way, we’ll have a delicious picnic lunch and plenty of photo stops before we arriving in Puerto Rio Tranquilo where we can then relax in a ski chalet-style lodge. We’ll stay here for two nights for some R&amp;R and the chance to explore the town’s best kept secret: the marble caves!</p>

If, however, you’d like to go on a different type of adventure and explore the marble caves, you can join the three-hour boat excursion to see the surreal caverns on Lake General Carrera.</p>

                                <p>Still itching to ride? Jump on the bike and ride around the lake, taking in the views of the Andes and chatting to local gauchos you’ll undoubtedly spot here. You can also try your hand at fly fishing or horse riding if you fancy.</p>

                                <p>Brace for the notorious Patagonian side winds today and let your imagination run wild: this is the real deal, the vast, faraway corners of Patagonia, sparsely dotted with a few remote ranches and small settlements here and there.</p>

                                <p>Lago Argentine, a lake we will skirt on our way to El Calafate, is so impossibly turquoise blue it looks like it has its own technicolor filter, but the secret behind the crazy hues of the water is the Perito Moreno glacier feeding the lake.</p>

                                <p>No trip to Patagonia would be complete without seeing the famous Perito Moreno glacier, a beast of an icefield towering 240 feet above the waters of Lago Argentino.</p>

                                <p>Glistening in the most incredible hues of blue and white, Perito Moreno glacier is a sight to behold: slowly advancing forward, this creaking, shuddering, breaking mass of ice looks like a frozen tsunami, and today, we’ll get to see it from up close.</p>

                                <p>It’s a scenic ride to the viewpoint of the glacier with plenty of twisties and big, sweeping curves along the way. When we arrive, we’ll leave the bikes at the parking lot and take a shuttle or do a short hike to admire the glacier from several different lookout points. Be sure to put on a warmer layer – it gets chilly near the glacier!</p>

                                <p>After exploring the Perito Moreno area, we’ll jump back on the bikes and return to El Calafate enjoying the breath-taking views of Lake Argentino. We recommend taking an hour or two to explore El Calafate on foot: it’s the adventure capital of Argentinian Patagonia and it’s worth checking out its quirky bohemian cafes, artisan shops, and local eateries.</p>

                            <p>It’s a long day with another border crossing – Tierra del Fuego belongs to both Chile and Argentina – but we promise the riding, the landscapes and the feeling of reaching Ushuaia will be the biggest reward yet.</p>

We’ll cross the enchanting Tierra del Fuego, once more heading for another short ferry crossing, then loop back towards Punta Arenas for a celebratory farewell dinner on the Chilean side.</p>
